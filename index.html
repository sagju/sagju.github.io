                        I am a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Guillermo Ordonez,
                        with an expected graduation date of May 2024. I am currently on the 2023-2024 job market and will be
                        available for interviews.

                        I am an applied theorist broadly interested in information economics. My work
                        has focused on two developments where the nature of information greatly affected
                        business and policy: (1) the boom of data-intensive practices among firms and (2)
                        the highly visible but sparsely informed management of the COVID-19 pandemic. These
                        papers are initial steps to a broader research agenda in information design, information markets,
                        and the economics of social data.

                        Technological innovations have allowed some sellers to collect detailed information about buyers.
                        We study these changes in the precision of sellers' demand information. Precision plays a central role
                        in the incentive to profit through more efficient trade versus more extractive trade 
                        - impacting aggregate surplus and its distribution. When buyers' preferences are more heterogeneous, 
                        imprecisely informed sellers prioritize extraction despite limiting trade. Precision relaxes this tension, 
                        allowing sellers to target extraction when it is less obstructive. It increases aggregate surplus and
                        benefits (hurts) buyers with a low (high) willingness to pay. However, when buyers are more homogeneous,
                        imprecisely informed sellers prioritize trade, and precision can reorient them towards extraction,
                        even decreasing aggregate surplus and hurting all buyers. In either case, precision raises recipient sellers' profits,
                        but it can benefit or hurt other sellers. The more competitive a market and the lower the precision of
                        sellers who upskill, the worse the profit externalities; nevertheless, these can be positive and allow all 
                        sellers to become more profitable. However, competition can also protect precision leaders by discouraging
                        laggards from catching up.

                        The COVID-19 pandemic presented an unprecedented challenge. Policymakers had
                        to manage a crisis with little information but under high public scrutiny,
                        particularly via cross-regional comparisons. We show how comparisons induce
                        herding of policymakers with popularity concerns and discuss its extent under
                        different scenarios. Policy contagion is stronger when shocks are sequential,
                        more correlated, and popularity concerns are larger. Ex ante,
                        it improves welfare, by disciplining biased policy agendas, but ex post,
                        it can decrease welfare, by incentivizing acquiescing to a biased public consensus.
