                        I am a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Guillermo Ordoñez,
                        with an expected graduation date of May 2024. I am currently on the 2023-2024 job market and will be
                        available for interviews.

                        I am an applied theorist broadly interested in information economics. My work
                        has focused on two developments where the nature of information greatly affected
                        business and policy: (1) the boom of data-intensive practices among firms and (2)
                        the highly visible but sparsely informed management of the COVID-19 pandemic. These
                        papers are initial steps to a broader research agenda in information design, information markets,
                        and the economics of social data.

                    <p class="abstractText">
                        Technological innovations have allowed some sellers to collect detailed information about buyers. We study these changes in a standard search-theoretic model of imperfect competition, featuring buyers with heterogeneous private valuations for quality, and introduce sellers who observe valuation signals of heterogeneous precision. Signals induce third-degree price discrimination, and their precision largely dictates whether they are used to increase trade or increase markups - impacting aggregate surplus and its distribution. When buyers' valuations are more heterogeneous, imprecisely informed sellers prioritize high markups despite limiting trade, and precision relaxes this tension, not only allowing them to pursue high markups when it is least obstructive but also primarily incentivizing low markup offers that increase trade upon signals indicative of low valuation - increasing aggregate surplus and benefiting (hurting) buyers with a low (high) valuation. However, when valuations are more homogeneous, imprecisely informed sellers prioritize trade, and precision can primarily incentivize high markup offers that limit trade upon signals indicative of high valuation, hurting all buyers and even decreasing aggregate surplus. In either case, precision makes sellers more profitable, but its effect on competitors can be positive or negative. Generally, competitors suffer (benefit) when laggards (leaders) gain precision.

                        The COVID-19 pandemic presented an unprecedented challenge. Policymakers had to manage a crisis with
                        little information but under high public scrutiny, particularly via cross-regional comparisons. We show
                        how comparisons induce herding of policymakers with popularity concerns and discuss its extent under
                        different scenarios. Policy contagion is stronger when shocks are sequential, more correlated, and
                        popularity concerns are larger. Ex ante, it improves welfare, by disciplining biased policy agendas,
                        but ex post, it can decrease welfare, by incentivizing acquiescing to a biased public consensus.
