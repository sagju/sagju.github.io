                        I am a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Guillermo Ordonez,
                        with an expected graduation date of May 2024. I am currently on the 2023-2024 job market and will be
                        available for interviews.

                        I am an applied theorist broadly interested in information economics. My work
                        has focused on two developments where the nature of information greatly affected
                        business and policy: (1) the boom of data-intensive practices among firms and (2)
                        the highly visible but sparsely informed management of the COVID-19 pandemic. These
                        papers are initial steps to a broader research agenda in information design, information markets,
                        and the economics of social data.

                        Technological innovations have allowed some sellers to collect detailed information about 
                        buyers. We study the effects of these changes in the heterogeneous precision of sellers' 
                        demand information. Precision plays a central role in the incentive to profit through more 
                        efficient trade versus more extractive trade - impacting total surplus and its distribution. 
                        The more heterogeneous buyers' preferences and the flatter sellers' costs, the greater the 
                        disposition of imprecisely informed sellers to profit through extraction despite limiting 
                        trade. Precision relaxes this tension, allowing sellers to target extraction when it is less 
                        damaging to trade. It increases aggregate surplus and benefits (hurts) buyers with a low (high) 
                        willingness to pay. However, in alternate settings, imprecisely informed sellers are 
                        predisposed to profit through trade, and expertise can reorient them toward extraction to 
                        such an extent that it decreases the surplus of all buyers along with the aggregate. In either 
                        case, precision makes sellers who acquire it more profitable, but it can benefit or hurt other 
                        sellers. The more competitive an economy and the lower the precision of sellers who upskill, 
                        the worse the profit externalities; nevertheless, externalities can be positive and allow all 
                        sellers to become more profitable. And yet, competition can also protect precision leaders by 
                        discouraging laggards from catching up.

                        The COVID-19 policy responses represent an unprecedented challenge. Policymakers
                        worldwide, have to react fast to a totally new type of crisis under enhanced
                        public scrutiny, as their policies are immediately compared across countries. We
                        show how relative comparisons induce herding when policymakers are concerned
                        by their popularity, and we discuss its extent under different scenarios. This policy
                        contagion induce some countries to choose less efficient policies than they would
                        in isolation or when facing a less correlated shock. Further, when shocks arrive sequentially,
                        first movers prompt coordination on their policies of later movers, albeit
                        inducing less distortions than when shocks are simultaneous. On average, however,
                        the policy coordination triggered by a common pandemic shock improves
                        welfare by disciplining biased policy agendas.
